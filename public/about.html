  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Maleyka. I graduated from <strong>Ondokuz Mayıs University</strong> with a degree in <strong>Molecular Biology and Genetics</strong>. 
    Even though my background is in science, I discovered a passion for technology and I'm currently working hard to become a professional <strong>Web Developer</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to my studies in web development (currently following the <em>Web Developer Angelina</em> course on Udemy), I've also worked in the field of <strong>Social Media Management (SMM)</strong> in several places. 
    These experiences helped me understand digital communication and the importance of personal branding online.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m building real projects to improve my skills and plan to share my journey and works openly on GitHub. I strongly believe in learning by doing and I'm committed to growing step by step every single day.
